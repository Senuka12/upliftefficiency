# Uplift Efficiency
## Boost Your Productivity with Alexa


###Uplift Efficiency 
is a very user-friendly Alexa skill that you can start using by just saying "Alexa, open Uplift Efficiency" to any supported device. 
It consists of 4 main features at the moment. 
• Day Planner 
• Productivity Timer 
• Screen Timer 
• Challenges


###Day Planner 
Organize your day and keep track of the tasks in your day.
Add all the tasks in a typical day including Sleep, Work/School, Sports and Exercises, Leisure and Custom Tasks. 
You can add the begin time and the end time for all these tasks, then we'll arrange all the tasks in an order and make it your daily routine. 
Then you can set reminders for the tasks in the day plan. You will be reminded when to begin and end the tasks in your day plan. 
Also you can edit the day plan or refer to it at anytime...


###Productivity Timer 
Boost your productivity by properly organizing your work-break pattern. 
You can choose one clock out of the 3 available clocks to begin with. You can choose between Pomodoro timer, 52/17 timer, Ultradian timer. 
After setting one default clock you can tell you work session. (Eg: "Begin a work session of 3 hours and 30 minutes") 
Then reminders will be set at every time you need to switch from work to break or break to work.
These reminders are just like any other reminder on Alexa, but they'll be set up automatically.


###Screen Timer 
Take care of your eyes; take a break while using devices with screens. 
Similar to the Productivity Timer you can ask Alexa to begin a screen session and you will be reminded every time you've got to take a break and get back to work.
This works according to the 20 20 20 rule, where you take a 20 second break every 20 minutes to look at something which is 20 feet away.


###Challenges 
5 Day Challenges to boost your efficiency. 
Just select a 5 day challenge and get started. Currently only 1 challenge is available, it is the sleep challenge. 
In the sleep challenge you need to do 5 tasks on 5 consecutive days before sleep. More challenges will be added in the future.


###Premium 
There is also a premium version. 
Currently the only advantage for premium users is setting up 4 accounts. Non-premium users can use only 1 account. 
But more features will be added in the future for premium users and customization will be allowed for Premium users.
